# MP4 Conversion Hub

A lightweight, Dockerized media processing hub designed for home servers like [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/). It watches folders, scans files for viruses using ClamAV, and converts videos to MP4 format with FFmpeg. Includes a web UI for monitoring, uploading, and managing jobs.

## Why MP4 Conversion Hub?

MP4 Conversion Hub is an ideal tool for home media servers where families or groups of friends want to share and consume video content easily.

Whether you're running Jellyfin, Plex, or a custom file server, one of the main challenges is ensuring that videos are in a format that can be streamed efficiently and universally. Thatâ€™s where MP4 Conversion Hub fits in.

MP4 Conversion Hub is Dockerized and designed to work seamlessly with other containers by sharing volumes. On a home server setup (e.g., CasaOS, Portainer, or manual Docker Compose), it's easy to:

- Mount a common input folder from your SFTP server (where users drop videos).
- Let MP4 Conversion Hub scan and convert those files to MP4 in a shared output folder.
- Point Jellyfin directly to that output folder to serve optimized content to all users.
